### Workshop (currently under review) at CHI'23


Hybrid Intelligence (HI) is a fast growing research area with the ambitious vision of creating human-AI collaborative systems, where humans and intelligent machines operate in mixed teams synergistically and proactively to achieve shared goals~\cite{akata2020research}. In the ideal HI scenario, humans and artificial agents complement each other’s limitations: Stereotypes, error proneness by tiredness, in-group favouritism and short memory, among others, affect humans and could be overcome by machine-driven decision-making. This is while the human feedback could help ensure the machines’ fairness, sample efficiency and task generalisability. This team collaboration requires complex interaction of the mixed agents, i.e. advanced capabilities in adaptation, collaborativeness, responsibility and interactivity, while at the same time taking into account social, cultural, ethical and legal considerations. 

To achieve successful interactions, HI requires contributions from modern AI fields (e.g. knowledge representation to reason about the world, machine and reinforcement learning to learn from and adapt to the world's experiences, natural language processing to communicate, multi-agent systems to design agents’ interactions, etc.), but also, importantly, fundamentally new solutions from disciplines that study closely-related problems. While AI often treats human users primarily as a source of data, Human-Computer Interaction practitioners have a long-standing tradition on creating ``user experiences'' without considering the details of their interaction with an intelligent system. Because of its goal, HI will need to build on both of these fields to create these so-called human-computer partnerships which benefit from advanced machine learning, but also empower and leave the user in control. As an example, generative theory,  instrumental interaction and reciprocal co-adaptation can help create interactive intelligent systems that are discoverable, adaptive and explainable~\cite{schmidt2021artificial}.
